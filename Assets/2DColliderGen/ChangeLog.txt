  2D ColliderGen - ChangeLog
===========================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1
-----------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility:
-  This version is compatible with SmoothMoves V2.2.0 again.
   (Fixed BoneAnimation problems introduced with this
    SmoothMoves version - member variables have changed.)

New Features:
-  Added support for OTTileMap. There is now a menu entry
   "2D ColliderGen/Orthello Specific/Add AlphaMesh Colliders To OTTileMap".

Bugfixes:
-  Previously the bottom-left pixel was not included in the
   outline of objects. This lead to an incorrectly bevelled
   bottom-left corner at a square box (and the outline had
   5 vertices instead of 4).
   
-  Fixed a bug with Alpha Opaque Threshold not being
   synchronized across all instances of a collider-group.

Version 1.0
